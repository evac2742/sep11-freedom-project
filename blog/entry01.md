### Context
For my **Freedom Project**, I decided to use **Kaboom** as my tool. It is a JavaScript game development tool. I chose **Kaboom** because it is mainly used for 2D games, and I wanted to create a **Boba Memory Card Match Game**. 

While tinkering with **Kaboom**, I learned:
* ***Kaboom({...}]*** which sets up the game screen
* ***loadSprite*** which displays images
* ***add()*** and ***pos()*** which places the cards and positions them
* ***wait()*** which is basically js time to see if the cards match

My plan is to make a card-flipping memory game with 6 different boba flavors. I have chosen those flavors and found images for each flavor: brown sugar, matcha, milktea, mixed, strawberry, and taro.

### Sources
While exploring my tool options, I also looked at **Phaser**. However, I didn't use this because it seemed too complex. So, I decided on using **Kaboom** since is seems easier to learn and works inside HTML and **Kaboom** has its own playground to test around in.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Right now, I am currently in the **planning and creating** stage.
I have decided the game I am going to create and found the tool I am going to use.

Next, I plan to start coding and testing out how to connects **Kaboom** with my game.

### Skills
* **Problem Solving**: I learned how to debug small issues like my sprites not loading. (Cause and effect)
* **Independent Learning**: By tinkering and learning this tool by myself, I have learned to work independently and teaching myself.
* **Planning/Organization**: By planning out my whole project with what topic I am going to do, and what tool I am going to use. I will then slowly build my project and make it come together.
