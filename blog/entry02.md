### Content
Since my last blog, I have made some progress on my **Freedom Project**. I have tested how to put the cards on screen and tried to learn the mechanics. This week I plan to put all my 6 of my boba flavor cards on screen and make them interactive.

Things I have learned:
* Organizing sprites on a grid layout
* How to use `onClick()` to interact with the cards when clicked
* How to add delay after flipping unmatched cards
* Debugging cards that lay over each other.

I refered to the Kaboom.js documents for coding references and practice.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am currently in the creating and testing phase of the engineering and design process. I have leard to build a basic structure and test game mechanics. My next steps are:
* all cards on screen with no overlays
* using `onClick()` to make cards interactive
* adding a pause after flipping 2 cards

### Skills
I have learned some skills since my first blog entry.
* **Problem Solving:** I fixed a big where my cards would overlap and I expiremented with cause and effect to fix the bug.
* **Learning Independently**: I am developing this skill still because I am learning how to use Kaboom by myself and teaching myself the mechanics.
* **Organization**: I learned to organize my grid and cards on my project.
