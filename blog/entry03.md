# Entry 3

### Content
Since my last blog entry, I have been working on my **Freedom Project** slowly with **Kaboom.JS**. I have been trying to improve my layout. I am still testing ``onClick()`` to make sure everything is running smoothly for my game. The matching system is still not complete and I'm still working on it.


What I have been working on:
* Adjusting grid layout
* Trying to make cards laid out evenly
* Experimenting flipping cards without them having a match yet
* Debugging issues if cards are uneven or unevenly spaced
* Making sure cards don't overlap

### Sources
Just like  my last blog, I continued to use **Kaboom.js documents** from the website. I also used the **playground** because I am able to experiment with the function while also learning about them.

* [Kaboom Documentation](https://kaboomjs.com/)
* [Kaboom Playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add)

### Engineering Design Process
I am still in the **creating** and **designing process**. I'm slowing designing and making sure the format and system of my code works smoothly before moving on.

**My next steps:**
* Finalizing the card layouts/positions
* Continue with card flip function
* Thinking about I will code if the cards match

### Skills
Some skills I have develop through this are:
* **Problem solving**: I fixed the layout of my code.
* **Organization**: Organizing system layout.
* **Independent Learning**: I slowly learn about **Kaboom.js** independently.
* **Debugging**: Noticed that I a single comma can mess up your whole code.
