# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Kaboom**

## Project: **Boba Match Game**

---

### 11/10/25:
**What I learned:**
* How to set up a basic **Kaboom** game canvas
* Initalizing the game
* Creating sprites

**Challenges:**
* At first I didn't know how `onClick()` worked in Kaboom but I had an a-ha moment when I realized it needed to be tied to a specific sprite.






### 11/17/25:
**What I learned:**
* How to use `add()` and `pos()` to add objects to the game
* How to loop arrays of sprites to apply to the boba tiles
* I also learned `destroy()` to remove the boba tiles


**Challenges:**
* Destroying a sprite immediately after detecting a match caused bugs. So, I added a delay.


**What I am going to try next:**
* Making the boba sprites clickable
* Moving a sprite when clicked
